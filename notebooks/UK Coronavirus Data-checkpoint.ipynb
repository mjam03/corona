    " - Invades Lungs: If your immune system doesn't fight it off, then it proceeds down your throat and finds more ACE-2 receptors in your lungs in the alveoli\n",
    " - Restricts Oxygen: Alveoli absorb oxygen from breathed in air into the blood - this is inhibited. Furthermore, your immune systme starts attacking infected alveoli further reducing oxygen absorption capability\n",
